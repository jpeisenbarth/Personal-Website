## About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher working in the SEDAN group at the SnT (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust) from the University of Luxembourg. I have a Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Lorraine (France) where I worked at the Loria laboratory within the RESIST group.

My thesis is on the Analysis, Exploitation and Protection of Public Blockchain Peer-to-Peer Networks, the manuscript is available [here](https://hal.univ-lorraine.fr/tel-04056712)(if you can read french).

My research interests include Network Management and Distributed Systems, especially the study (measurements, monitoring, analysis, security) of peer-to-peer (p2p) networks. My work focuses on public blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP-Ledger) underlying p2p networks.
